  <hr class="full" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span>

<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>According to an official of the Imperial
Japanese household, the poems
composed by the late <span class="sc">Dowager-Empress
of Japan</span> numbered 30,000. But these
were never published, and the <span class="sc">Empress</span>
died universally respected.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A foolish hoax is said to have been
perpetrated on the authorities at Dublin
Castle. An anonymous communication
informed them that a <i>Dreadnought</i> had
been purchased by the Ulster loyalists,
and would shortly make her appearance
off the coast of Ireland disguised
as an outrigger. Urgent instructions
were in consequence issued to the
coastguards not to be caught napping.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"I honestly hope," said General
<span class="sc">Villa</span>, "that the Americans will bottle
up Vera Cruz so tight that one can't
even get water into it." But this surely
would place America's teetotal navy
in a very awkward predicament.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>His Majesty King <span class="sc">Ferdinand</span> of
Bulgaria has, a Paris newspaper informs
us, purchased four elephants as
pets. We trust that this is the beginning
of the end of the toy-dog craze.
We have always considered elephants
more interesting, and ladies no doubt
will not be slow to realise that there is
more effect to be got out of them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The dogs which are to accompany his
expedition are, Sir <span class="sc">Ernest Shackleton</span>
states, coming to London and will
spend some little time here. It is to be
hoped that they will be given a good
time and shown the sights, and that
no one will be so thoughtless as to
mention emergency rations in their
presence.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Says Mr. <span class="sc">Filson Young</span> in <i>The Pall
Mall Gazette</i>:&mdash;"I began yesterday by
swimming in a sunlit sea, continued it
by motoring through a hundred miles
of lilac and gorse, and ended it listening
to the most perfect concert programme
at Queen's Hall that I have ever
heard.... Was it not a happy day?"
The answer, <span class="sc">Filson</span>, is in the affirmative.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Forty years ago, &pound;1,000 a year was
spent on wines and spirits at the
Medway (Chatham) Workhouse and
Infirmary, while to-day the annual
expenditure is only &pound;5. In these hard
times even paupers have to economise.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>St. Mark's Church, Tunbridge Wells,
which has been troubled with a plague
of flies, has had to be closed for a week
for the purpose of fumigation. Many
members of the congregation had complained
of being kept awake by these
vivacious insects.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Apparently the modistes have resolved
that this shall be a butcher's year, for
we are promised leg-of-mutton sleeves,
ham-frill skirts, and pork-pie hats.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Although M. <span class="sc">Jean Worth</span>, the
famous creator of fashions, has declared
that the mania of modern
women for changing styles of dress
amounts to a disease, it is not, we
understand, the present intention of
any of the leading dressmaking firms
to offer a prize for a cure for this
ailment.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>M. <span class="sc">Worth</span> also stated that "Quality,
not quantity," is the right motto for
women in matters of dress. For all
that, we trust that the irreducible
minimum has now been reached.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to the calculations of a
M. <span class="sc">Verronet</span>, the earth has only
another two million years to live. We
hope that the effect of this statement
may not be to encourage jerry-building.</p>

<h2>THE CRITIC AT THE R.A.</h2>

<p>"Talking of treacle pudding," said
Felicity, helping that delicacy with a
grace and skill that would have demanded
the entire concentration of one
less gifted&mdash;"talking of treacle pudding,
I suppose you've done the Academy?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," I confessed.</p>

<p>She looked at me reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," she sighed, "when
will the British Public awaken to the
claims of Art? We haven't either."</p>

<p>"I generally wait a bit and find out
which are the pictures I am expected
to admire."</p>

<p>"And a very sensible plan too," she
rejoined; "that is, for you and me and
the rest of the common herd. Of course
Papa's different. He's a critic."</p>

<p>Her father coughed deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"When he sees anything really
artistic," she went on, "it fills him
with delight."</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't use that horrible
word, Felicity," he groaned.</p>

<p>"What horrible word?"</p>

<p>"Artistic."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Papa; I forgot. On the
other hand," she continued unabashed,
"if you show him anything that <i>isn't</i>
it causes him terrible suffering. He
will cover his eyes with one hand and
shoo it away with the other."</p>

<p>"You mustn't mind my little daughter's
nonsense," he said. "Someone
told her the other day she had a sense
of humour. It was a great mistake."</p>

<p>"That's one up to you, Papa," she
returned cheerfully; "but before the
House adjourns I should like to move
that we all go to the Academy this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I should love it," I replied, "but
I'm afraid I must get back to work."</p>

<p>"Do you <i>work</i>?" she exclaimed with
rapture. "How frightfully exciting."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At a Flapper dance in the evening
I met Felicity again and she gave me
the second "Hesitation Waltz." Afterwards
she led me to some nice basket
chairs in the conservatory.</p>

<p>"Well, did the Academy come off?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"Did it come off?" said Felicity.
"I should say so. It was the nicest
afternoon I've had for weeks. You
<i>ought</i> to have been there."</p>

<p>"I suppose your father was in hot
form criticising the pictures?"</p>

<p>"Hush," she whispered, holding her
finger to her lips. "Papa as an Art
critic is temporarily under a cloud.
I'll tell you. It came about in this
way: Papa is a great admirer of
<span class="sc">Sargent</span>, and to-day he was in a particularly
Sargentesque mood. 'The
great drawback to the Academy,' he
said, as we were setting forth, 'is that
the Sargents are spoiled by the other
pictures. The huge mass of these all
over the place entirely destroys one's
perceptions of colour value. What I
should like to do would be to see only
the Sargents, turning a blind eye meanwhile
to the other paintings.'"</p>

<p>"'You ought to wear blinkers,' I
suggested.</p>

<p>"He was all for it at once.</p>

<p>"'That's a capital idea, Felicity.'</p>

<p>"'Then you'll go by yourself, Papa,'
I said. 'I'll do some shopping and
call for you at the police station on
the way home.'</p>

<p>"Well, he abandoned the blinker idea
eventually, but stuck to his scheme for
concentrating on <span class="sc">Sargent</span>, and suddenly
I saw how the afternoon might
be made both amusing and instructive.
So I said, 'There's one thing that's
rather pleasing, Papa. You won't have
to buy a catalogue, because I've got
one. Some people I had tea with
yesterday gave me theirs, and I'll
bring it if you like.'"</p>

<p>She looked at me mischievously under
her long dark lashes.</p>

<p>"You catch the idea?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," I said, "not yet."</p>

<p>"Well, as soon as we arrived Papa
took the catalogue and looked up all the
Sargents&mdash;in the index part, you know,
and wrote the numbers on his cuff and
then we began to hunt them down.</p>

<p>"The first one was a 'still life.'
Papa viewed it in some perplexity.
'Ah,' he said at length, 'just as I
thought. I have been anticipating this
for some time.' He adjusted his spectacles.
'The tendency of modern Art&mdash;that
is to say the best Art&mdash;is towards
a return to more classic forms.
<span class="sc">Sargent</span>, as might be expected, leads
the way; but he infuses the subject
with his own special genius. I regard
this as a very line example&mdash;very fine,
indeed. The vitality of the half salmon
is positively amazing.'</p>

<p>"I led him gently away, and presently
we stood before the portrait of a City
gentleman&mdash;the kind that is very fond
of turtle soup. Papa raved over it.</p>

<p>"'Here, again,' he pointed out, 'see
the loving care bestowed on each link
in the watch-chain. What a reproof
to the slovenly slap-dash methods of
the Impressionists.'</p>

<p>"I gazed rapturously into his face
and urged him onward. Things went
from bad to worse, but it was really
'The Lowing Herd' that put the lid
on it. A more lamentable company of
cows you could hardly imagine. Even
Papa was baffled for the moment; but
after checking the number on the picture
with the number on his cuff he
pulled himself together.</p>

<p>"'Wonderful grouping,' he said;
'eminently Sargentesque;' and his
voice seemed to challenge all within
earshot to name another artist who
could have produced the work.</p>

<p>"'Well, now,' he concluded, 'I think
that is the last of them, and the best
thing we can do is to go home. It
would be a pity to spoil the afternoon
by looking at any of the lesser lights.'</p>

<p>"I hesitated. 'Don't you think,' I
suggested, 'it would be nice just to
look at the Sargents before we go?'</p>

<p>"For some moments Papa was
speechless.</p>

<p>"'The Sargents!' he exclaimed at
length. 'Well, of all the&mdash;&mdash;Here
I devote a solid half-hour to teaching
you something about Art and your mind
is woolgathering the whole time. What
on earth were you thinking about?'</p>

<p>"'I was thinking about the years
that are gone,' I said.</p>

<p>"'The years that are gone?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, and I'm afraid it's entirely
my fault, because I brought it.'</p>

<p>"Papa gasped.</p>

<p>"'What on earth is the child talking
about?'</p>

<p>"'The catalogue,' I said; 'it's some
other year's.'"</p>

<p>At this moment the fallen Art critic
entered the conservatory.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Felicity?" he exclaimed.
"You're cutting a dance
with your own father. I never heard
of such a thing."</p>

<p>She sprang up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa!" she cried, "I <i>am</i> sorry."</p>

<p>She slipped her arm through his, and
as they moved away together I heard
her say, with what seemed unnecessary
distinctness, "We were talking Art,
you know, and that's so dreadfully
absorbing."</p>

<h2>NOVELIST AND MILLIONAIRE.</h2>

<p>Fortified by the inspiring example
of Mr. <span class="sc">Upton Sinclair</span>, who recently
picketed the offices of the Standard Oil
Company in New York with a view to
bringing pressure to bear on Mr. <span class="sc">John
Rockefeller</span>, Junr., Mr. Alf. Abel, the
famous Manx novelist, has adopted
similar measures to bring Mr. <span class="sc">Andrew
Carnegie</span> to reason. The trouble is of
long standing and has grown out of
the movement inaugurated by Mr. Abel
to induce municipalities and local
authorities to refuse the gifts of Free
Libraries. Such benefactions, as Mr.
Abel has most conclusively shown, while
nominally intended to educate the
masses, in reality have the result of
restricting the sale and circulation of
those works of fiction which conduce
most effectively to the culture, the intellectual
emancipation and the moral
uplift of the nation. Worse still, they
reduce the legitimate emoluments which
the authors of these noble works derive
from their beneficent labours. Owing
to this pernicious system the number
of copies sold of Mr. Abel's last work
only readied 250,000 copies, instead of
400,000, as he and his publisher, Mr.
Goethemann, confidently expected. Mr.
Abel has memorialised the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span>, but without effect, and at
last determined to take decisive action
himself. Accordingly, having chartered
a swift steamer manned by Manx fishermen,
and carrying 500 volunteers wearing
the national uniform, Mr. Abel set
out from Douglas (I. of M.) on Wednesday
last and, landing in the neighbourhood
of Dornoch on Friday night,
advanced early next morning on Skibo
Castle, the seat of Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span>.</p>

<p>The famous millionaire, who is an
early riser, was playing the organ in
the central hall of the Castle when he
was apprised of the approach of the
raiders by one of his retinue, and at
once determined to organise a stubborn
resistance. The portcullis was let down,
the moat filled to its utmost capacity,
while Winchester rifles were served out
to the four butlers, sixteen footmen,
seven chauffeurs and twenty-four gardeners
who compose the staff. The
organist was instructed to play martial
music to hearten the defenders, while
Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span> took up his position in
the bomb-proof gazebo which is so
prominent a feature in the Sutherland
landscape. Meantime Mr. Abel, advancing
at the head of his volunteers,
had taken cover behind an Araucaria
and addressed an ultimatum to Mr.
<span class="sc">Carnegie</span> through a megaphone. It
was to the effect that unless he promised
to forbid the supply of Mr. Abel's novels
to his Free Libraries, Mr. Abel would&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Let loose 1,000 Manx cats in
Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie's</span> preserves;</p>

<p>(2) Permanently establish himself in
the neighbourhood of Skibo and follow
Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span> about wherever he went,
in Elizabethan costume;</p>

<p>(3) Make Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span> the villain
of his next novel;</p>

<p>(4) Give free recitations from his
works in Dornoch and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>The situation was extremely critical
when Mr. Jenery Hames, the illustrious
American novelist, who was staying
with Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span>, gallantly offered
his services as a mediator, and, sallying
forth under a flag of truce, entered into
negotiations with Mr. Abel. After a
protracted interview a <i>via media</i> was
reached by which, while Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span>
undertook to exclude Mr. Abel's works
from his Free Libraries, Mr. Abel agreed
to withdraw his threat of coming to
reside in Sutherlandshire on the understanding
that Mr. Jenery Hames contributed
a six-column appreciation of
Mr. Abel's works to <i>The Times</i>, provided
that the demands of golf on the
best pages of that journal permitted it.
Subsequently Mr. <span class="sc">Carnegie</span> entertained
the Manx Volunteers at a sumptuous
<i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>, at which Mr. Hames proposed
the health of Mr. Abel and Mr. Abel
fell on the neck of Mr. Hames. No
other casualties occurred to mar the
peaceful termination of what might have
proved an international catastrophe.</p>

<h2>BLANCHE'S LETTERS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Week-End-on-Sea.</span></p>

<p><i>Park Lane.</i></p>

<p><span class="sc">Dearest Daphne</span>,&mdash;I've been doing
Easter with the Clackmannans and
helping them with an idea they're
carrying out. There's a little coast
town on their Southshire property
(Shrimpington it's been called up to
now), and they're turning it into a
seaside place <i>that people can go to</i>!
<i>Isn't</i> that dilly? Of course, our coasts
quite <i>bristle</i> with seaside towns, but
they're places people <i>can't</i> go to because
<i>everybody</i> goes there. And so
the Clackmannans are going to supply
a long-felt want, as old-fashioned people
say, and give us a <i>ville de bains</i> of our
very <i>very</i> own. Its name is to be
changed from Shrimpington
to Week-End-on-Sea.
It has no railway station,
which, of course, is a great
merit; it's not to have any
big blatant hotels or pensions&mdash;nothing
but charming
bungalow-cottages;
there'll be no pier, no
band, none of those banal
winter-gardens and impossible
pleasure palaces that
<i>ces autres</i> delight in, and,
<i>of course</i>, none of those
immensely fearful concert
parties and pierrots. But
we shall have a troupe of
mermen and mermaids who
will do classic gambols by
the marge of the sea and
play on pipes or shells or
whatever it is that sea-creatures
play on. There'll
be bathing parties, when the last syllable
of the last word in bathing-kit will
be seen; paddling parties, in carefully
thought out <i>toilettes pour marcher dans
l'eau</i>, and shell-gathering parties. Stella
Clackmannan, who has such an active
brain that everyone's quite anxious
about her, is going to have tons of
really pretty shells laid along a part
of the beach (above high water), and
people will go shell-gathering <i>en habit
coquilleux</i>.</p>

<p>The only feature Week-End-on-Sea
will have in common with other seaside
places is a parade. At first Stella
wouldn't hear of having one; but Norty
told her there's "a deep-seated primal
instinct in human nature for sitting
on benches and watching one's fellow-creatures
walk up and down, and it
would not be wise to thwart this instinct."
He's an enormously clever
boy, and, when it was put to her like
that, Stella gave in. So there's to be
a parade on the sea front, and Ray
Rymington, whose sense of the beautiful
is <i>absolutely</i>, will see after it.
There'll be none of those ghastly
glass shelters, but just darling Sheraton
benches at intervals, and the paraders
will be carefully <i>censored</i>. Nobody who
hasn't <i>something</i> of a profile will be
allowed to walk up and down&mdash;and no
woman who takes more than 4's in
slices or who's wearing a last year's
sleeve. So you see, dearest, it will be
quite a <i>cachet</i>, both of person and
style, to be seen walking on the parade
at <i>our</i> watering-place. The Bullyon-Boundermere
woman met Stella in
town the other day and said, "My
dear duchess, how can we thank you
for at last giving us a really <i>classy</i> seaside
place?" "What a wonderful word,
Mrs. Boundermere!" answered Stella.
"'<i>Classy</i>'! Do tell me what it means!"</p>

<p>Oh, my best one! Such a simply
<i>sumptuous</i> storyette for you! Even in
<i>your</i> remote fastnesses you must have
heard of young Ivan Rowdidowsky, the
very <i>very</i> latest thing in Russian composer-pianists.
Playing the piano with
his elbows, dressed in scarlet velvet, and
fuller of "inner meanings" than anyone
(even from <i>Russia</i>) ever was before,
he captured London at the beginning
of the Little Season, and his vogue has
been <i>colossal</i>. He gave twelve elbow-recitals
of his own compositions at
Emperor's Hall. Those fearsome interviewers
fairly mobbed him, and he
told them, in the <i>prettiest</i> broken English,
that "piano playing with the
hands suited well enough the pale-blooded
law-abiding people of yesterday,
but that the full-pulsing stormy
emotions of to-day could only be
adequately expressed by the <i>elbows</i>!"
Quite <i>myriads</i> of people made him
write, "Your affectionate friend, Ivan
Rowdidowsky," in their autograph-books,
till at last he had cramp in the
hand and Sir William Kiddem had to
be called in. There were reassuring
bulletins telling the public that they
needn't be alarmed about their favourite,
as cramp in the band is <i>rarely</i> fatal
and does <i>not</i> affect the elbows, and
that, if M. Rowdidowsky stopped writing
in autograph-books for a day or
two, he'd be quite his wonderful self
again.</p>

<p>Popsy, Lady Ramsgate, has been
<i>folle de lui</i> from the first, and at
Easter she'd a big party for him down
at "Popsy's Pleasaunce," her place in
Sussex, and then and there announced
that she was engaged to him, and that
after her marriage she would drop the
Ramsgate title and be known by "her
Ivan's beautiful Slavonic name!" People
were very nice to her about it and
didn't laugh more than they
could help, and all went
cheerily, Rowdidowsky in
his scarlet velvet playing to
them with his elbows every
evening; and then one fatal
morning (as novelists say)
Popsy picked up a letter
that her Ivan had dropped
from his pocket. It was addressed
outside to "M. Rowdidowsky,"
and this is an
extract from what she read
<i>inside</i>: "I was at your
show at Emperor's Hall the
other day and thought I
should have split my skin
at the way the silly jossers
all round me were carrying
on, and at the thought that
it was my pal, good old
Bert Smith of Camberwell,
perched up on the platform
in red velvet togs pounding away on the
old piano with his elbows like a good
'un. I put my hands over my face to
prevent myself from bursting out, and
the woman next to me shoved a silver
bottle under my nose and gurgled into
my ear, 'You've an artist-soul! I felt
just as you do when I first heard this
divine Rowdidowsky!' The silly geeser!
Go it, old son! More power to your
<i>elbows</i>! And don't forget, when you've
made your pile, that your old pal,
Joe, was part-author of the idea and
helped you to work it out!"</p>

<p>Popsy, poor old dear, is having the
Gurra-Gurra treatment for nervous collapse.
Lord and Lady Ramsgate are
enormously relieved at the turn things
have taken; and their boy Pegwell said
to me yesterday, "I'm jolly glad it's all
off! Fancy how <i>decomposed</i> it would
have been to have Rumtidumsky, or
whatever his name was, for a step-grandfather!"</p>

<p>Ever thine, <span class="sc">Blanche</span>.</p>

<h2>THE COMPETITION SPIRIT.</h2>

<p>About six weeks ago a Canadian
gentleman named Smith arrived in the
Old Country (England). He knew a
man who knew a man who knew a
man ... and so on for a bit ... who
know a man who knew a man who
knew me. Letters passed; negotiations
ensued; and about a week after he
had first set foot in the Mother City
(London) Smith and I met at my Club
for lunch.</p>

<p>I may confess now that I was nervous.
I think I expected a man in
a brown shirt and leggings, who would
ask me to put it "right there," and tell
me I was "some Englishman." However,
he turned out to be exactly like
anybody else in London. Whether he
found me exactly like anybody else in
Canada, I don't know. Anyway, we
had a very pleasant lunch, and arranged
to play golf together on the next day.</p>

<p>Whatever else is true of Canada there
can be no doubt that it turns out
delightful golfers. Smith proved to be
just the best golfer I had ever met, being,
in fact, when at the top of his form,
almost exactly as good as I was. Hole
after hole we halved in a mechanical
eight. If by means of a raking drive
and four perfect brassies at the sixth
he managed to get one up for a moment,
then at the short seventh a screaming
iron and three consummate approaches
would make me square again. Occasionally
he would, by superhuman play,
do a hole in bogey; but only to crack
at the next, and leave me, at the edge
of the green, to play "one off eleven."
It was, in fact, a ding-dong struggle all
the way; and for his one-hole victory
in the morning I had my revenge with
a one-hole victory in the afternoon.</p>

<p>By the end of a month we must have
played a dozen rounds of this nature. I
always had a feeling that I was really
a better golfer than he, and this made
me friendly towards his game. I would
concede him short putts which I should
have had no difficulty in missing myself;
if he lost his ball I would beg
him to drop another and go on with
the hole; if he got into a bad place in
a bunker I would assure him it was
ground under repair. He was just as
friendly in refusing to take these advantages,
just as pleasant in offering similar
indulgences to me. I thought at first
it was part of his sporting way, but it
turned out that (absurdly enough) he
also was convinced that he was really
the better golfer of the two, and could
afford these amenities.</p>

<p>One day he announced that he was
going back to Canada.</p>

<p>"We must have a last game," he
said, "and this one must be decisive."</p>

<p>"For the championship of the
Empire," I agreed. "Let's buy a little
cup and play for it. I've never won
anything at golf yet, and I should love
to see a little cup on the dinner-table
every night."</p>

<p>"You can't come to dinner in Canada
<i>every</i> night," he pointed out. "It would
be so expensive for you."</p>

<p>Well, the cup was bought, engraved
"The Empire Challenge Cup," and
played for last Monday.</p>

<p>"This," said Smith, "is a serious
game, and we must play all out. No
giving away anything, no waiving the
rules. The Empire is at stake. The
effeteness of the Mother Country is
about to be put to the proof. Proceed."</p>

<p>It wasn't the most pleasant of our
games. The spirit of the Cup hung
over it and depressed us. At the
third hole I had an eighteen-inch putt
for a half. "That's all right," said
Smith forgetfully, and then added,
"perhaps you'd better put it in,
though." Of course I missed. On
the fifth green he bent down to brush
away a leaf. "That's illegal," I said
sharply, "you must pick it up; you
mayn't brush it away," and after a
fierce argument on the point he putted
hastily&mdash;and badly. At the eighteenth
tee we were all square and hardly on
speaking terms. The fate of the Mother
Country depended upon the result of
this hole.</p>

<p>I drove a long one, the longest of
the day, slightly hooked.</p>

<p>"Good shot," said Smith with an
effort. He pressed and foozled badly.
I tried not to look pleased.</p>

<p>We found his ball in a thick clump of
heather. With a grim look on his face,
he took out his niblick....</p>

<p>I stayed by him and helped him
count up to eight.</p>

<p>"Where's your ball?" he growled.</p>

<p>"A long way on," I said reproachfully.
"I wish you'd hurry up. The
poor thing will be getting cold."</p>

<p>He got to work again. We had
another count together up to fifteen.
Sometimes there would be a gleam of
white at the top of the heather for a
moment and then it would fade away.</p>

<p>"How many?" I asked some minutes
later.</p>

<p>"About thirty. But I don't care,
I'm going to get the little beast into
the hole if it takes me all night." He
went on hacking.</p>

<p>I had lost interest in the performance,
for the Cup was mine, but I did
admire his Colonial grit.</p>

<p>"Got it," he cried suddenly, and the
ball sailed out on to the pretty. Another
shot put him level with me.</p>

<p>"Thirty-two?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About," he said coldly.</p>

<p>I began to look for my ball. It had
got tired of waiting and had hidden itself.
Smith joined gloomily in the search.</p>

<p>"This is absurd," I said after three
or four minutes.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" said Smith, suddenly
brightening up. "If your ball's lost
I win after all."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; you've given the hole
up," I protested. "You don't know
how many you've played. According
to the rules if I ask you how many,
and you give wrong information&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's thirty-five," he said promptly.</p>

<p>"I don't believe you counted."</p>

<p>"Call it forty-five then. There's
nothing to prevent my calling it more
than it really is. If it was really only
forty, then I'm counting five occasions
when the ball rolled over as I was
addressing it. That's very generous
of me. Actually I'm doubtful if the
ball did roll over five times, but I say
it did in order to be on the safe side."
He looked at his watch. "And if you
don't find your ball in thirty seconds
you lose the hole."</p>

<p>It was ingenious, but the Mother
Country can be ingenious too.</p>

<p>"How many have you played exactly?"
I asked. "Be careful."</p>

<p>"Forty-five," he said. "Exactly."</p>

<p>"Right." I took my niblick and
swung at the heather. "Bother," I
said. "Missed it. Two."</p>

<p>"Hallo! Have you found it?"</p>

<p>"I have. It's somewhere in this
field. There's no rule which insists
that you shall hit the ball, or even that
you shall hit near the ball, or even that
you shall see the ball when you hit at
it. Lots of old gentlemen shut their
eyes and miss the sphere. I've missed.
In five minutes I shall miss again."</p>

<p>"But what's the point?"</p>

<p>"The point, dear friend," I smiled,
"is that after each stroke one is allowed
five minutes in which to find the ball.
I have forty-three strokes in hand;
that gives me three hours and thirty-five
minutes in which to look for it.
At regular intervals of five minutes I
shall swing my club and probably miss.
It's four-thirty now; at eight o'clock,
unless I find my ball before, I shall be
playing the like. And if you are a
sportsman," I added, "you will bring
me out some tea in half-an-hour."</p>

<p>At six-thirty I was still looking&mdash;and
swinging. Smith then came to
terms and agreed to share the cup with
me for the first year. He goes back
to Canada to-morrow, and will spread
the good news there that the Old
Country can still hold its own in
resource, determination and staying
power. But next year we are going to
play friendly golf again.</p>

<h2>THE EAVESDROPPER.</h2>

<p>It may not be generally known that,
on very still nights, in the small hours,
when there are no taxis rushing past
and no late revellers returning home, it
is possible, by leaning against a pillar-box
and placing one's ear close to the
opening, to hear the letters converse.
Provided, of course, that one has a pure
soul, as I have. Otherwise there is no
sound.</p>

<p>Chancing to be out late the other
night in a very quiet neighbourhood,
I suddenly noticed a pillar-box and was
reminded that I had a letter to post.
I dropped it in and held my breath as
I listened.</p>

<p>"Here's another!" said a voice.
"Who are you, pray?"</p>

<p>"I'm an acceptance with thanks,"
said my letter.</p>

<p>"What do you accept?" another
voice asked.</p>

<p>"An invitation to dinner," said my
letter, with a touch of swank.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the other. "Only
that."</p>

<p>"It's at a house in Kensington,"
said my letter rather haughtily.</p>

<p>"Well, <i>I'm</i> an acceptance of an invitation
to a dance at a duchess's," was
the reply, and my poor letter said no
more.</p>

<p>Then all the others began to chatter,</p>

<p>"I contain news of a death," said
one.</p>

<p>"I bring news of a legacy," said
another.</p>

<p>"I demand the payment of a debt,"
said a sharp metallic voice.</p>

<p>"I decline an offer of marriage," said
a fourth, rather wistfully.</p>

<p>"I've got a cheque inside," said a
fifth with a swagger.</p>

<p>"I convey the sack," said a sixth in
triumph.</p>

<p>"What do you think I am?" another
inquired. "You shall have six guesses."</p>

<p>"Give us a clue," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Very well. I'm a foolscap envelope."</p>

<p>Then the guessing began.</p>

<p>One said a writ.</p>

<p>Another said an income-tax demand.</p>

<p>But no one could guess it.</p>

<p>"I'm a poem for a paper," said the
foolscap letter at last.</p>

<p>"Are you good?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>"Not good enough, I'm afraid," said
the poem. "In fact I've been out and
back again seven times already."</p>

<p>"Guess what I am," said a sentimental
murmur.</p>

<p>"Any one could guess that," was the
gruff reply. "You're a love-letter."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said the sentimental
murmur. "But how clever of you!"</p>

<p>"Well," said another, "you're not
the only love-letter here. I'm a love-letter
too."</p>

<p>"How do you begin?" asked the
first.</p>

<p>"I begin, 'My Darling,'" said the
second love-letter.</p>

<p>"That's nothing," said the first; "I
begin, 'My Ownest Own.'"</p>

<p>"I don't think much of either of
those beginnings," said a new voice.
"I begin, 'Most Beautiful.'"</p>

<p>"You're from a man, I suppose?"
said the second love-letter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," said the new one.
"Aren't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm from a woman," said the
second. "I'll admit your beginning's
rather good. But how do you end?"</p>

<p>"I end with 'A million kisses,'"
said the new one.</p>

<p>"Ah, I've got you there!" said the
second. "I end with 'For ever and
ever yours.'"</p>

<p>"That's not bad," said the second,
"but my ending is pretty good in its
way. I end like this, 'To-morrow will
be Heaven once more, for then we meet
again.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop all this love talk!"
said the gruff letter, when I was conscious
of a hand on my arm and a
lantern in my face.</p>

<p>"Here," said the authoritative tones
of the law, "I think you've been
leaning against this pillar-box long
enough. If you can't walk I'll help
you home."</p>

<p>Thus does metallic prose invade the
delicate realms of supernature.</p>

<h2>NATURE STUDY.</h2>

<p>The following letter may have been
noticed in the columns of <i>The Daily
Eye</i> some weeks ago:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><i>The Lilac Grove</i>,</p>
<p><i>Moonvale Park, S.E.</i></p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;On looking out of my bedroom
window this morning at 6 o'clock I
observed a cuckoo eating ripe strawberries
in the garden next but one to
mine. It occurs to me that for a
cuckoo to be in a suburban garden
eating ripe strawberries so early in the
year as April 15 is somewhat unusual.
Can you tell me whether this has ever
been known before?</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yours etc.,</p>
<p><span class="sc">Augustus Quest</span>.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>We understand that the following
further letter has been sent to the
Editor of <i>The Daily Eye</i> by the writer
of the above, but has not appeared in
print:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir</span>,&mdash;Some days ago I sent you a
letter in which I mentioned that on
April 15th a cuckoo was seen eating
ripe strawberries in the garden next but
one to mine, and asking whether you
could tell me if anything of the kind
had been known before. But up to the
present I have received no reply. The
only result of my letter has been the
receipt of a number of circulars announcing
works on the subjects of
nature study and fruit culture. From
a publisher's announcement which has
been sent to me, giving specimen pages
from "How to Tell Our Feathered
Friends at a Glance," I discover that
the bird I saw in my neighbour's
garden could not possibly have been a
cuckoo, its body being altogether too
small. And in conversation with my
neighbour in the train this morning I
learnt that his garden does not contain
strawberries; the bird, whatever it
was, must therefore have been eating
something else.</p>

on part of Opposition
to place <span class="sc">Premier</span> once more

Questions relating to "the

Startling things have happened

Ulster, a real one, not
compact of circumstantial

planned scheme successfully
carried out in the dead of
the night, when honest
citizens, including the police
and the military, were
sound asleep. Telegraphic
and telephonic communications
were ruthlessly cut;
cordons of armed men were
drawn round selected spots.
Thus surrounded and protected
the conspirators landed large
quantities of rifles and ammunition,
distributing them through the country
by relays of motor-cars.</p>

<p>Something like a "plot" this, dismissing
into ignominious shade report
of bloodthirsty intentions of <span class="sc">First Lord
of the Admiralty</span> and the <span class="sc">Ex-Secretary
of State for War</span>.</p>

<p>Interest in the old plot being thus
suddenly, dramatically cooled by vigorous
birth and development of the
young 'un, it might reasonably have
been expected that elaborate preparations
for fanning it would be dropped,
and House would straightway get to
business on the genuine thing. Not a
bit of it. Hon. Members who had in
interests of the nation spent ingenuity
and energy in compiling ninety-four
Questions addressed to <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>
not to be denied pleasure of putting
them.</p>

<p>As usual in similar circumstances
not much change got out of <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.
Answered sometimes by monosyllable;
never exceeded a score of words. Yet
none could complain of incompleteness
of reply. Performance occupied full
period allotted to Questions. When
hand of clock pointed to quarter-to-three,
the time-limit of intelligent
curiosity, thronged House drew itself
together, awaiting next move with
breathless interest. How would the
Government take this midnight outbreak
of armed and disciplined men?</p>

<p>Lying down? or standing
up sternly to grapple with
it in their capacity as custodians
and champions of
established law? Inquiry
voiced from Ministerial side,
where Members are growing
increasingly impatient
with benevolent neutrality.
<span class="sc">Premier's</span> reply brief but
weighty.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/353b.png"><img width="100%" src="images/353b.png" alt=""/></a><p>THE QUESTION CRAZE.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The Battle of Belfast, 19&mdash;</i>.</p>

<p>Galloper <span class="sc">F. E. Smith</span>, of the Ulster Volunteers, to ask the <span class="sc">war
minister</span> what are the next tactical dispositions to be carried out by the
Military forces of the Crown.</p>

<p>"Do these right hon. gentlemen really suppose that they will be able
to conduct a campaign against the Government on the field and at the
same time to ask the Government all the awkward questions they can
think of about their military operations?"&mdash;<i>Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span></i>.</p></div>

<p>"In view of this grave
and unprecedented outrage,"
he said, "the House
may be assured that His
Majesty's Government will
take without delay appropriate
steps to vindicate
the authority of the law and
to protect officers and servants
of the <span class="sc">King</span> and His
Majesty's subjects in the
exercise of their duties and
in the enjoyment of their
legal rights."</p>

<p>Cheer after cheer from
excited Ministerialists punctuated
the ominous sentences.
There was no
counter-demonstration from
the Opposition.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Lords,
abandoning rumoured intention
of forcing crisis by
throwing out Army Bill on
Second Reading, passed the
stage without debate. In the Commons
Plural Voting Bill read a second
time.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;In crowded House two
nights' debate opened on motion by
<span class="sc">Son Austen</span> demanding Judicial Inquiry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span>
into the "Plot." Circumstances peculiar.
Attack on Government planned
last week. Since then what is called
"a great Coup," as distinct from an
unnamable "Plot," startled the world
and upset things generally. <span class="sc">Austen</span>,
above all things systematic and orderly,
insists on limiting discussion to the
"Plot." The wily <span class="sc">Winston</span> equally
determined, on chatting about the
"Coup."</p>

<p>Pretty play, watched with keen interest
by critical audience. <span class="sc">Austen's</span>
speech pleasantly differed from some
familiar of late from same quarter.
Luminous, lucid, temperate yet firm,
it did much to uplift debate with tone
of late lamentably lacking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/353c.png"><img width="100%" src="images/353c.png" alt="" /></a><p>
Horror and indignation of the Rev. Sir
<span class="sc">Chadband Byles</span> at the grave prospect of
a conciliatory attitude on the part of the
Government towards the Ulster "rebels."</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Winston</span>, whilst once more replying
in detail to insinuations and allegations
upon which existence of the "Plot" is
based, preferred to talk about the
"Coup." This naturally goaded Opposition
into recriminatory retort. Incidentally
it led to exhibition of fine
generosity and good feeling, innate in
House of Commons, peculiarly welcome
just now.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Winston</span> was drawing vivid picture
of great Conservative Party "committed
by its Leaders to a policy of
armed violence, to tampering with the
discipline of the Army and Navy, to
overpowering the police, coastguards
and Customs officials, to smuggling
arms by moonlight."</p>

<p>From centre of Opposition Camp
rang the cry, "Shall we let him go
on?" Then came the noble inspiring
answer from <span class="sc">Winterton</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh yes, let him go on."</p>

<p>So they did, right on to the end,
reached by earnest appeal for peaceful
settlement of a question which
between the varied circumstance of
"Plot" and "Coup" has already brought
Ulster within touch of civil war.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Motion made from
Front Opposition Bench for Judicial
Inquiry into the "Plot." Following
upon sound and fury there may be observed
indescribable, but unmistakable
tendency towards peace.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;When, as happened in
respect of three speeches, debate on
motion for Judicial Inquiry turned aside
to deal with critical situation in Ireland,
it rose to heights commensurate with the
national interests involved. Yesterday
<span class="sc">Winston</span>, towards close of speech particularly
exasperating to Opposition,
suddenly sheathed his sword and waved
the olive branch. The happy accident
of <span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span> chancing to resume
debate this afternoon gave it
at outset the lofty tone echoed and
preserved by <span class="sc">Carson</span> and the <span class="sc">Premier</span>.
As the latter said, it was impossible for
anyone to listen to concluding passage
of <span class="sc">Prince Arthur's</span> speech without
liveliest emotion. Finely conceived, its
message was conveyed in language
whose eloquence had the charm of
simplicity and sincerity. <span class="sc">Carson's</span>
yearning for a really united Ireland was
greeted with sympathetic cheers. The
<span class="sc">Premier's</span> declaration that he "had
never closed the door against a peaceful
solution of the problem, and until compelled
by absolute force of circumstance
will never do so," gave fresh assurance
of a happy issue of what twenty-four
hours earlier seemed hopeless dilemma.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Austen Chamberlain's</span>

Hall, the way led for a quorum
of Members by that youthful athlete
Sir <span class="sc">Thomas Roe</span> (<i>&aelig;at.</i> 80), he came
upon party of grubs which, obedient
to family tradition that goes back for
centuries, had eaten into it. Conveyed
choice specimens to his room and carefully
provided for their comfort.</p>

<p>His favourite is the <i>Xestobium tesselatum</i>,
which boasts that at least
35 per cent. of the damage to historic
roof stands to its credit. Turns out to
be lively, intelligent creature. <span class="sc">Wedgwood</span>,
always thoughtful of other
people's tastes, brought down with
him from the roof (in <span class="sc">Thomas Roe's</span>
pocket) a few chips. One of these he
placed in a saucer borrowed from the
tea room. Here the grub, which for
brevity we will call X., lives. In incredibly
short time X. burrowed through
the wood, its bright intelligent eyes
gleaming out on the other side, as who
should say, "Here I am again."</p>

<p>Expects in time to be able to make it
converse. Busy teaching it difference
between a coup and a plot. Hasn't
grasped it yet, its mother tongue
being Norman-French. But prospect
promising.</p>

<h2>THE FUSER.</h2>

<p>In a moment of expansion, Sheila
Armitage confided in me that she has
worked it out, and that we are third
cousins twice removed. I accept her
word for this, because I have to work
at other things, getting a living and so
forth, while her sole occupation is to
acquire a <i>flair</i> as a hostess, week-ends
being her speciality.</p>

<p>I hope that I am not unkind to
Sheila when I say that she seems to me
more attractive when she is either in
trouble or ill-health; in her more joyous
moods I simply do not belong&mdash;and do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span>
not want to belong&mdash;to her life. A friend
of mine once called her a social pirate,
and there is no doubt that her method
of collecting the people whom she
wants is to besiege them until they
eventually surrender. Why, however,
Bobbie Outram is always asked to her
smartest week-ends was a conundrum
to me until I met her magnificently
convalescing after influenza at Folkestone.
For I know Bobbie, and I
would run a mile or two any day to
avoid him.</p>

<p>Sheila was in a bath-chair, but looked
radiantly well, and at once gave me a
list of her latest victims.</p>

<p>"They sound all right," I said. "But
will Bobbie Outram like them?"</p>

<p>At this she gave a little gurgling
laugh and put two fingers on my arm.</p>

<p>"Of course you know Bobbie. I
forgot."</p>

<p>"I kicked him at school, I loathed
him at Cambridge, and let him know it,
and he is still all over me. He brags
about you whenever he sees me before
I see him."</p>

<p>"He is the greatest success I have
ever had," she declared.</p>

<p>"Then Heaven help you," I replied.</p>

<p>"You don't understand; you think
it's quite easy to collect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"People tell me you tried to found a
<i>salon</i>, but only got as far as a Zoo," I
interrupted.</p>

<p>For an instant she frowned, then she
gurgled again.</p>

<p>"Brenda Thornton told you that,"
she protested. "It's just her jealousy.
As a fact I'm quite good at getting
only the right people. Fliers have
rather had their day, though they are
still useful, and I like an explorer or
two for week-ends, though the best
kind seems to be always exploring.
But Brenda was getting ahead of me&mdash;I
don't mind confessing that to you&mdash;until
I thought of Bobbie Outram.
He's my one stroke of genius; even
David admits that."</p>

<p>"I never thought much of your husband's
taste," I said brutally, and then,
"in men," I added gently, as she was
recovering from influenza.</p>

<p>She smiled again and continued:</p>

<p>"There is one thing that is indispensable
to a successful week-end."</p>

<p>"It can't be Bobby Outram," I
declared.</p>

<p>"It is, or somebody like him; but he
is easily the best. Bobbie is my point
of contact."</p>

<p>"He used often to be my boot's,"
I growled.</p>

<p>"The more you can fuse your guests
the better," she went on, as if she were
giving a lecture. "Everyone knows
that; it's the A B C of entertaining;
but they must have something to agree
about&mdash;a sort of rallying point. And I
was the first hostess to discover that
no party is complete unless you have
someone in it whom all the others can
most cordially abuse."</p>

<p>"So that is Bobbie's <i>m&eacute;tier</i>?" I said.</p>

<p>"The help that man has been to
me on wet Sundays is beyond belief,"
she replied ecstatically; "and Brenda
Thornton is absolutely furious."</p>

<p>"I never expected to be sorry for
Outram, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Jack, you needn't worry
about Bobbie. He knows all right. I
told him, and he enjoys it. He's really
rather a dear."</p>

<p>But at this my gorge rose. "At
any rate," I said, "he's going to
Mrs. Thornton's from next Friday to
Tuesday; he told me so yesterday."</p>

<p>"The little worm," said Sheila.</p>

<p>"'Worm' is the word," I said; and
as we remained to abuse Bobbie for
another ten minutes with much mutual
goodwill I suppose he had once more
justified his existence by a successful
feat of "fusing."</p>

<hr />

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p>"<span class="sc">The Clever Ones</span>."</p>

<p>I do wish I had been one of the
clever ones, for they seemed to be in
Mr. <span class="sc">Sutro's</span> confidence and able to
penetrate the obscurity of his motives.
At first even I could understand something
of the scheme, which ran (as I
thought) like this:&mdash;<i>Wilfrid Callender</i>,
a rich bachelor of Harrow and Oxford,
has a socialist friend, <i>David Effick</i>, at
whose meetings he happens to have encountered
a Girton girl, <i>Doris Marrable</i>
(pretty daughter of a hop-merchant
in affluent circumstances), who affects
revolutionary ideals. In order to win
the approval of this lady he represents
himself as an anarchist plumber, earning
five pounds a week; and to the horror
of her family they become affianced.
Having no sort of intention of keeping
up the imposture, even if he could, and
being fearful lest the exposure of his
wealth and education would, in her
present state, alienate her affections,
he proposes by practical demonstration
to disgust her with the mode of life
which she designs to lead. In collusion
with <i>Effick</i> he arranges that he shall
invite <i>Doris</i> to take tea at his friend's
attic in Bethnal Green, and reveal to
her the sordid conditions of existence
in that quarter.</p>

<p>So far good, and the delightful first
Act was rich in promise. Then came
the complexities. There was another
girl, <i>Rose Effick</i> (a rich relation of the
socialist), to whom <i>Callender</i> should
have been engaged but for a misunderstanding.
It is her business to divert
him back to his old love. You would
naturally say that, if it is <i>Callender's</i>
object to disgust <i>Doris</i> with the life of
the people, so that she may change her
mind and take him for what he actually
is, it will be <i>Rose's</i> object, since her aim
is the frustration of this design, to make
Bethnal Green as attractive as possible,
so that <i>Doris</i> will refuse to sacrifice her
ideals when she learns the truth about
<i>Callender</i>. Yet it looks as if <i>Rose</i> is
playing <i>Callender's</i> game and not her
own. At first, it is true, she tries to make
the attic more supportable; imparts a
pleasant flavour to the meal; dismisses
the hurdy-gurdies that <i>Callender</i> has
chartered from the Universal Provider.
But subsequently she goes slumming
with <i>Doris</i> to such good purpose that
the latter turns sick of the whole thing.
Now, you will say, <i>Callender's</i> way is
clear; he will reveal his identity and
<i>Doris</i> will be prepared to tolerate his
wealth. On the contrary, Mr. <span class="sc">Sutko</span>
is not to be defeated by his own
machinations; he means to bring <i>Callender</i>
and <i>Rose</i> together; so he just
takes and throws them into one
another's arms and consigns <i>Doris</i> to
an old admirer whom we have never so
much as set eyes on.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/356.png"><img width="100%" src="images/356.png" alt=""/></a><p>A HAIR-AND-TIE ANARCHIST.</p>

<p><i>Wilfrid Callender</i>: Mr. <span class="sc">Gerald du Maurier</span>.</p></div>

<p>I hope I am more lucid than I seem
to myself to be&mdash;more lucid, anyhow,
than Mr. <span class="sc">Sutro</span>, who has threatened to
damage an excellent scheme by defiance
of the first law of drama, even of farce,
namely, that the audience should be
permitted to know what the author is
after. Nor, again&mdash;though of course
he was not asking to be taken seriously&mdash;was
he very particular about the
probability of some of his characters.
<i>Doris</i>, for instance, was required to be
too many things at once. A bluestocking
and a <i>sansculotte</i> (not a very
usual combination), she was also a
woman of the very latest cry in frocks.
Miss <span class="sc">Nina Sevening</span> looked pretty and
wore them well, but beyond this she
gave us very little help. <i>Rose</i>, too
(charmingly played by Miss <span class="sc">Marie
L&ouml;hr</span>), who disguised herself as a
dweller in Bethnal Green by the simple
expedient of a duster pinned over her
shoulders&mdash;how could Mr. <span class="sc">Sutro</span> expect
her dainty skirt and smart white shoes
to escape the eye of this "clever"
female, her rival?</p>

<p>All the same, he gave us much matter
for mirth, though the Second Act, which
promised so well, was dragged out by
interminable trivialities over the preparations
for tea. I wish that authors
and actors would understand how depressing
it often is when people on the
stage will insist on keeping things bright
and brisk with domestic details.</p>

<p>As for the wit of "the clever ones"&mdash;<i>Doris</i>
and her mother and her aunt&mdash;I
don't know how the first-nighters
took it, but when I was there a great deal
of it (when audible) was over the heads
of the audience. They understood all
right the humour of things when somebody
(not a clever one) said "Damn,"
but I wonder how many of them appreciated
the symbolic force of the term
<i>&eacute;picier</i>, or grasped the purport of <i>Quem
deus vult perdere prius dementat</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Sutro</span> owed much to the excellence
of his cast. Mr. <span class="sc">Gerald du
Maurier</span> was, of course, inimitable;
but there were also Miss <span class="sc">Florence
Haydon</span>, Miss <span class="sc">Mary Brough</span> and
Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund Gwenn</span>, all delightful in
their own specialised veins of humour&mdash;the
plaintive, the rich, the uproarious.
But Mr. <span class="sc">Holman Clark</span> had not
enough scope for his unique qualities.</p>

<p>I hear rumours of a revision, and
hope that this means that I shall
receive an invitation to renew a most
delightful evening. For my only real
criticism is that Mr. <span class="sc">Sutro</span> thought me
more intelligent than I actually am&mdash;an
error that I always encourage.</p>

<hr />

<p>"<span class="sc">Dusk.</span>"</p>

<p><i>Account Rendered</i>, a comedy of some
promise, but produced with an extraordinary
inadequacy in the matter of
what the programme called "the
decors," has been very quickly withdrawn
from the Little Theatre. But its
curtain-raiser, <i>Dusk</i>, is to be retained
for the revival of <i>Magic</i>.</p>

<p>That is nearly all that I have to
say about Mr. <span class="sc">Vansittart's</span> "Oriental
Fantasy." It deals with a youthful
bride who has just been attached to
a Persian hareem. In the garden at
dusk she finds a young English traveller
(who has just told us what a <i>penchant</i>
he has for "women, women, women"&mdash;he
is very insistent about this), and
being caught in conversation with him
is placed by her lord in a sack and consigned
to the deep; but not before she
has explained in fluent verse that in the
circumstances this abrupt end to her
young career has no terrors for her.
But for this courageous attitude on
her part I should have experienced
greater relief when the hero appeared
next morning in his pyjamas and
indicated that the regrettable incident
was a figment of his sleeping brain.</p>

<p>I thought I detected some good
lines among the Englishman's remarks
(though I did not like his voice), but
I prefer to study poetical drama at
leisure before attempting to pass any
comment on it. I may add that I
don't suppose that that engaging actor,
Mr. <span class="sc">Fred Lewis</span>, has ever previously
played the part of a Persian slave with
a taste for philosophic recitation; and
I hope he never will again, for, frankly,
it is not his <i>m&eacute;tier</i>.</p>

<h2>A SPORTING CHANCE.</h2>

<p>It is generally in the spring that I
begin to notice how big my accounts
are growing. I don't know why this
should be, unless it is because I haven't
paid any during the previous year. At
any rate you must take my word for it.
I have the accounts here.</p>

<p>Then, again, it is a most remarkable
fact that whenever one has bills to
pay one finds there are other things to
be bought.</p>

<p>A few days ago I discovered that my
tailor wanted thirty pounds. I also
discovered that I wanted a lighter overcoat
and a raincoat. It was a nice
problem.</p>

<p>On occasions of great difficulty like
this I always consult Edith. Edith
might have married me if it hadn't
been for Henry. Had she accepted
me I should probably have gone in for
something. As it is I just go on
existing.</p>

<p>The really sad part of the whole
affair is that she seems to be very fond
of me. Poor girl! We all make
mistakes. Anyhow, apart from her
momentary mad infatuation for her
husband, she is very sensible and I
always like to consult her. Married
women are so different from single
girls; I don't know why, unless it is
that they have husbands.</p>

<p>Edith being married, therefore, I
rang her up.</p>

<p>"I want," I said, "to consult you
financially."</p>

<p>"Certainly," she replied. "What is
it?"</p>

<p>"Private. I will come round to tea."</p>

<p>I rang off. I made a little parcel of
my accounts and then telephoned for
a taxi. In due course I found Edith
in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Hello," she said. "Is it very bad
trouble?"</p>

<p>"We are," I replied, "in deep water.
Life is very shallow." Edith laughed;
she appreciates wit.</p>

<p>"Well, let me see if I can help."</p>

<p>I sat down. "I want two new
coats," I explained. "My tailor is
clamouring for thirty pounds, balance
of account owing, and," I added significantly,
"there are others. It is going
to be a big smash."</p>

<p>"Poor boy!"</p>

<p>I sighed heavily as I opened the
accounts.</p>

<p>"Here we are," I said. "Tailor,
thirty pounds."</p>

<p>I paused and again sighed.</p>

<p>"Hatter, three pounds."</p>

<p>"Three pounds?" Edith looked
amazed.</p>

<p>"That's your fault. I bought a new
hat for your wedding. Not only was I
best, but best-dressed man. I wore
beautiful clothes to hide a breaking
heart."</p>

<p>Edith smiled. "A beautiful hat was
perhaps superfluous," she suggested.
"They are worn so little in church.
Are there any more?"</p>

<p>"Plenty. Hatter, three pounds;
Glover, one pound&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Gloves. Need I go through the
sad list?"</p>

<p>Edith shook her head. "What's the
total?"</p>

<p>"Fifty-four pounds, thirteen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span>
fourpence. I'm hoping to avoid the
fourpence in discounts. Total spare
cash, twenty pounds, and nearly three
months to go before I touch any more."</p>

<p>"Poor boy, have you really only
twenty pounds?"</p>

<p>"To throw about in bills, certainly.
I shall want all my other money for
rent and food and cash payments."</p>

<p>"And are they all clamouring for
their money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the sharks."</p>

<p>Edith lay back in her chair and
thought. Suddenly she sat up.</p>

<p>"It can't be helped," she said.
"Some of them will have to wait.
We'll put their names in a hat and the
first three we draw out get paid."</p>

<p>"Yes," I objected, "but what about
my overcoats?"</p>

<p>"You must wait."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "I have a better idea."
I paused impressively. "I think that
we can fairly assume that my creditors
are sportsmen. At any rate, they must
have the benefit of the doubt. That
being so, I put my own name in the
hat and draw against them. If I'm in
the first three I get my new coats."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not a word." I slipped noiselessly
out of the room and came back with
Henry's Homburg. In less than five
minutes everything was prepared.</p>

<p>"Now," said Edith, and she put her
hand in the hat. There was a tense
silence. "(1) Glover, (2) Tobacconist,
(3) Tailor. Bad luck!"</p>

<p>I suppressed a groan. Had I not
been sitting down, I should probably
have reeled. Then, with an effort, I
pulled myself together and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right," I said.</p>

<p>"All right?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said; "I can pay off
the first two."</p>

<p>"But what about the tailor?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that," said I.
"I shall make a distinction in his
favour. I shall give him an order for
two coats. Surely that means more to
him than a mere settlement."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Edith doubtfully. "But
of course you'll pay him the money?"</p>

<p>I laughed amazedly. "My dear
girl! Either I pay his account just
like the other two, or I distinguish him
by ordering the new coats. He can't
have it both ways. And I couldn't
very well pay for the new coats, if
that's what you mean, before the old
account is settled. You see that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but still it doesn't seem&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, perhaps not," I said, "perhaps
not, at first sight. I hardly saw it
myself at first. It was really a clever
idea of yours."</p>

<p>Edith brightened visibly. "Yes,
wasn't it?" she said.</p>

<h2>AN EPIC FROM THE PROVINCES.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Charles</span>,&mdash;I know that
from your superior standpoint as a
Londoner you are disposed to regard us
as dwellers in a quiet backwater, unswayed
by the currents of political
strife, but you must not imagine that
the stirring events of the past few
weeks have failed to leave their mark
on the life of our little town. A study
of the Press&mdash;that faithful mirror of
our time&mdash;would quickly convince you
to the contrary.</p>

<p>The Press, as you know, is here
represented by <i>The Signal</i>, a fine old
weekly journal of inflexible Unionist
views. Well, last week, rising on a
wave of enthusiasm, <i>The Signal</i> burst
into poetry.</p>

<p><i>The Gun Runners</i>, it is called, by
"Cecilia Merrifield."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The air is still, the night is dark;</p>
<p class="i2">Along the harbour side</p>
<p>There stands a silent, waiting park</p>
<p class="i2">Of motors, full inside.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That is the opening stanza. You may
possibly take exception to the French
rhyme, but you cannot fail, Charles, to
appreciate the fine spirit of it.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>What are they full of? Not of man,</p>
<p class="i2">But rifles, neatly packed,</p>
<p>Taken from out the good ship <i>Fan</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">Now in the harbour backed.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Strictly speaking, I believe it was
not the <i>Fan</i> at all, but that is a
small matter.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Brave men have toiled across the sea</p>
<p class="i2">To bring those rifles in,</p>
<p>With helm held stoutly hard-a-lee</p>
<p class="i2">Amid the breakers' din.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I am not at all certain of the
accuracy of the term "hard-a-lee" in
this connection, but what a fine sense
of stedfast heroism that run of aspirates
awakened. "With helm held stoutly
hard-a-lee."</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Amid the breakers' strident cry</p>
<p class="i2">They kept their courage cool,</p>
<p>For thus, they said, Home Rule must die,</p>
<p class="i2">We will not have Home Rule!</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>They 'scaped the vessels of the Fleet</p>
<p class="i2">By lavish use of paint;</p>
<p>The warships had to own defeat</p>
<p class="i2">With loud and long complaint.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But I cannot give you more than
a selection from these noble verses.
They continue in the same lofty strain
until the good ship is warped safely
in port. Then comes another dramatic
change of tense. We are again
on the quayside.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The night grows darker. All at once</p>
<p class="i2">An order sharp we hear&mdash;</p>
<p>The order waited for for months;</p>
<p class="i2">The motors come in gear.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Yes, I admit that this stanza is open
to criticism on more than one count,
but I would not have it changed. It
bears the impress of red-hot inspiration.</p>

<p>Criticism must always be silent when
confronted with that.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The joy of having to obey</p>
<p class="i2">Lights up each driver's face,</p>
<p>And so the motors move away</p>
<p class="i2">Each to its destined place.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>You must not suppose, however, that
there was no show of opposition. As
you have observed, our poetess believes,
on the whole, in sticking closely to
historical truth.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The minions of the Government,</p>
<p class="i2">A weak and craven breed,</p>
<p>Stand by, quite helpless to prevent</p>
<p class="i2">This great heroic deed.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I cannot say I altogether like the
tone of the second line, but the fury of
enthusiasm, shackled by the exigencies
of rhyme, must be forgiven much. Let
us continue.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Across the night the motors throb</p>
<p class="i2">Without the slightest hitch,</p>
<p>For this is quite a business job,</p>
<p class="i2">Though in romance so rich.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Indeed, the whole stupendous plot</p>
<p class="i2">Is cleverly arranged;</p>
<p>Even the motor-cars have got</p>
<p class="i2">Their number plates all changed.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And so they speed by tortuous ways</p>
<p class="i2">With Freedom in the van,</p>
<p>And patriotism sets ablaze</p>
<p class="i2">The face of every man.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And so on. Then we come from the
general to the particular, and follow
the fortunes of a single consignment of
arms until it reaches its destination.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>And into cellar, pantry, shed,</p>
<p class="i2">In kitchen, bedroom, loft,</p>
<p>The rifles go. Home Rule is dead!</p>
<p class="i2">The words are uttered oft.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The ammunition, too, is hid</p>
<p class="i2">In many a secret hole,</p>
<p>Each bearer doing as he's bid,</p>
<p class="i2">Intent upon the goal.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The goal being, I take it, the final
death of Home Rule. And now comes
the wonderful peroration, in which the
whole great adventure is brought to its
dignified and eloquent climax. It runs
into twenty-three stanzas, of which I
will give you the last two without
comment&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Freedom is what we labour for,</p>
<p class="i2">Freedom, it is our right;</p>
<p>We have no wish for bloody war,</p>
<p class="i2">But, if we must, we'll fight.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>This is our message sent to him,</p>
<p class="i2">The dark Dictator's tool&mdash;</p>
<p>Whatever happens, sink or swim,</p>
<p class="i2">We Will Not Have Home Rule!</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>There, Charles! I challenge you to
produce anything approaching that
from all your boasted London dailies.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p><span class="sc">Robert</span>.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>Doubtless you will think, as I did at first, that the title
of <i>The Priceless Thing</i> (<span class="sc">Stanley Paul</span>) has reference to
love or something intense like that. Far from it. Not in
fifty guesses would you be likely to discover that its real
meaning is an autograph of the late <span class="sc">William Shakspeare</span>.
One knew already that Mrs. <span class="sc">Maud Stepney Rawson</span> could
write a vigorous and bustling tale. If I have a complaint
to make against <i>The Priceless Thing</i> it is indeed that it
suffers from some superfluity of plot, and what approaches
a plethora of villains, real or supposed. For this reason it
is a story more than usually hard to condense fairly into a
paragraph. Briefly, however, the P. T., which was the
peculiar treasure of the noble line of <i>Annerslie</i>, lived in a
case in the library of their ancestral home. The heroine,
<i>Anstice</i>, a relation of the Family, was employed by My
Lord as librarian. When I tell you, moreover, that <i>Anstice</i>
had run away from her own father on finding that he
was an expert manufacturer of literary forgeries, and that
her circle of friends included an American blackmailer, a
curiosity dealer and a mad Italian who was even better at
the forgery business than her own father, you will perceive
that the poor girl was likely to find her situation "some
job." I could not begin to tell you what really happened.
Towards the end there had been so much mystery, and the
story had become such a palimpsest of forged signatures,
that I myself knew no more than <i>Lord Annerslie</i> in which
to believe. But I think we both had the upholding conviction
that an affair of this kind was bound to come out
all right in the end. Which indeed it did; leaving all the
virtuous characters abundantly satisfied, a feeling that will,
I am sure, be shared by Mrs. <span class="sc">Rawson's</span> maze-loving public.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">Robert Tressall</span> was a house-painter, a Socialist, and
very evidently a sincere if somewhat raw thinker. He left
to his heirs and assigns a manuscript of many thousand
words. It was a novel, oddly entitled <i>The Ragged Trousered
Philanthropists</i> (<span class="sc">Grant Richards</span>), and fell into the hands
of Miss <span class="sc">Jessie Pope</span>, who recognised the genius in it (none
too strong a word), made some excisions, and now stands
sponsor for it to the world. It is a grim story of the unpicturesque
and horribly anxious lives of working-folk,
specifically of the house-painter and his mates working
on a job, elated and satisfied at the beginning, depressed
and despondent as the work nears completion with the
uncertainty as to how long it will be before another job
comes along. Nobody who hadn't lived exclusively in this
hard environment could have written with such candour
and intensity. Mr. <span class="sc">Tressall</span> has avoided altogether the
pretentiousness and literary affectation that betrayed, for
example, Mr. <span class="sc">H. G. Wells'</span> bathchairman, <span class="sc">Meeks</span>. The
earlier part of the book is better than the later, where
the propagandist ousts the chronicler. The exposition of
Socialist doctrine is made with a considerable if a crude
skill. It is disfigured with certain familiar limitations;
the author can recognise no work except that done with
the hands; and, whether by unhappy accident of actual
circumstance or through defect of temperament, he sees
his employers with a disproportionate bitterness that somewhat
discounts his indictment, while he views his fellow-workmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span>
from rather a disdainful height. But <i>The Ragged
Trousered Philanthropists</i> is a book to be read by any who
want an insight into the conditions of working-class life
at its average, with its virtues, its vices, its courage, its
intolerable piteous anxieties.</p>

<hr />

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Grant-Watson</span> is one of the most resolute and intrepid
novelists I have met, and his directness of speech
may give offence, I fear, to the more reticent of his readers.
His story of two white men and <i>Alice Desmond</i>, freed from
the social conventions and let loose among the natives on
a remote island in the Pacific, proceeds apace and with little
regard for the susceptibilities of civilisation and refinement.
Familiar but rarely printed language is used when occasion
demands; primitive passions stalk naked and unashamed;
and when murder is to be done it is done brutally, forthwith
and notwithstanding the respective merits, from an heroic
point of view, of active and passive agents. Being myself
so situated in life that I am never likely to take part in
any affair more passionate
and drastic than a
football match or a law-suit,
I found the savage
reality, the candour and
the unbridled wrath of
<i>Where Bonds are Loosed</i>
(<span class="sc">Duckworth</span>) most welcome
by contrast. It
gave me pleasure to see
a man's annoyance being
worked off by the use of
fists, knives and bullets,
a woman's impatience
spending itself in immediate
violence, and love
and hatred being expressed
in sharp and decisive
action rather than
in deliberate subtleties of
conversation. In short,
Mr. <span class="sc">Watson</span> left me wondering,
somewhat fondly,
to what lengths I myself
might go in my more
heated moments if I too
were isolated on Kanna Island and beyond the supervision
of police-constables and next-door neighbours.</p>

<hr />

<p>Once upon a time it was my lot to read a slender volume
of Prose Poems, all about stars and rivers and moons and
such other things of which prose poetry is made, and
written by the most intense and soulful young woman who
ever put pen to paper. Which, being perused, I handed
to another and elder woman, noted for a great reader of
books. And after many days, and after (I suppose) much
fruitless toil on the part of my friend, the volume was
returned to me with this single comment, "It seems very
racily written." I tell you the story, which being true is
without point, because I have been wondering what the
same critic would have found to say about another slender
booklet called <i>The Word of Teregor</i> (<span class="sc">Nisbet</span>). My idea of
it is that Mr. <span class="sc">Guy Ridley</span>, the author, knows and admires
his <span class="sc">Kipling</span> and delights in his <span class="sc">Maeterlinck</span> to such
extent that (possibly after a visit to <i>The Blue Bird</i>) he felt
himself inspired to sit down and write these Forest-Jungle-Book
tales of an earlier world, wherein Man and Beast and
all created things were subject to the benevolent rule of
<i>Teregor</i>, the Oak-tree; when everything living had a voice
and used it, pleasantly enough, in rather mannered prose
of the "Yea, Nay and Behold" type; and when all the
old legends had yet to be started in ways of which Mr.
<span class="sc">Ridley</span> gives his own most original explanations. So if
you care about this kind of thing (and I had quite a
pleasant half-hour from it myself) get it. You will at least
find here a book entirely different from anything else in
the library-box; printed in type that is a pleasure to the
eye, and having, moreover, the classic excuse of being a
very little one.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have for some time watched a steady improvement in
the work of Mr. <span class="sc">Ralph Straus</span>. It is therefore a pleasure
to greet <i>The Orley Tradition</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) as his best yet.
The <i>Orley</i> tradition was to do nothing whatever, and, like
the House of Lords in <i>Iolanthe</i>, to do it very well. They
were, as a family, noble, of ancient lineage, and fine stupidity.
<i>John Orley</i>, the hero of the tale, starts out to follow
worthily in the footsteps of his race, as a brainless but agreeable
country magnate. Then comes an accident, which
thwarts his physical ambitions
and awakens his
mental. Thereafter he
essays the life of affairs&mdash;and
fails all round; is
defeated for Parliament,
and equally worsted in
the lists of Art. So, being
now recovered of his
hurt, he says a graceful
farewell to the career intellectual
and resumes
the traditional <i>Orley</i> existence.
This, in brief,
is his story; but I give
it without the pleasant
style of Mr. <span class="sc">Straus's</span>
telling. There are many
very happily touched
scenes; more especially
had I a guilty sympathy
roused by one in which
poor <i>John</i> endeavours to
concentrate his very slipshod
brains upon an
afternoon of hard reading.
And almost all the characters are alive, from the entertaining
old lady who keeps the village post-office to <i>Mrs.
Adderson</i>, the naughty novelist in whose hands <i>John Orley</i>
completed his sentimental education. As for the setting, I
fancy that those who have spent their summers round
about St. Margaret's Bay will have little difficulty in
identifying <i>Handsfield</i>. Altogether a happy book (more so
than you would expect from its theme) and one that
marks, as I said, the further advance of a ready and
agreeable writer.</p>
